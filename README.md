# Robotic-Manipulator-Configuration-Space-Simulation 
A pygame based interactive simulation for the given robotic manipulator and contraints. Simulates workspace and configuration space side by side. You can simulate the motion of the manipulator in the workspace and the configuration space by using key presses to change the current robot configurations and obstacle positions.
 
## Pygame Simulation Controls:
- Press W/A/S/D: Move Robot in workspace and configurate space. Simulates collision by changing colour of link 
- Press 8/5/4/6: Move an obstacle
- Press G: Simulate the motion trajectory from current to goal configuration

## Environment
- Set up a Python 3.12 environment. Python 3.12 [Miniconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
- Install the required packages by using pip and the provided requirements.txt file
